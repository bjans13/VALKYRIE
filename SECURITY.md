## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of VALKYRIE seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please open a [GitHub Security Advisory draft](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for this repository **or** contact the maintainer privately on github /bjans13. You should receive a response within 72 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up through the same private channel to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. privilege escalation, command injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Preferred Languages
